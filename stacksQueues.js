//Stacks is a type of data structure the resembiles stacking plates. (like kitchen plates)
//they are stacked on top of each other and you can only access the top plate.
//LIFO. last in first out.
//they are very good when you need the last value and is good in language efficient engines
//browser history is a stack. an undo button's idea comes from a stack.
//pop O(1), push O(1), peek O(1), lookup O(n)

//Queues are like a line of people waiting to eat.
//the first person to arrive is the first person to go.
//FIFO first in first out.
//queues are used alot in programming problems and interview questions.
//resturant app, uber, lift, a printer. all use Queues
//lookup O(n), enqueue O(1), dequeue O(1), peek O(1)

//why would you not wanna use an array to build a queue?
//I would say it is because when you remove from the front of an array
//everything has to shift forward and will take more time o(n) I believe.

//JS does not have its own stack or queues data structure.
//we have to make it.

//Stacks
//we vist google, udemy, youtube. in that order on a browser
//we can build it with arrays or linked lists
